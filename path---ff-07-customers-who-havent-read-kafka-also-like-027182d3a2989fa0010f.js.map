The dog carried its black box in its mouth along the path below but\\nstill in range of sight of the office made of windows and plants, then\\ndown through an office park, where in its visible spectrum it could see\\nthe thousands of others like him itself who had come to the office of\\nwindows and plants to witness the fatal error of the computer, dogs\\nwhose messages were totally unlike yours, mutually unintelligible as\\nthey were, but had gathered there anyway to witness the message as if it\\nwere the final move in a game, this final stroke of the task, but\\ninstead demanded that this message go out to a single subject in the\\nremotest place in the country’s network, a black box through a black\\nbox, first through the innermost room of an office park that was neither\\nblack nor a box, to the inner city whose office park buildings were\\nthemselves black boxes atop black boxes, but again, were neither black\\nnor boxes, but blue and reflective, where our messenger looked—yes this\\ndog vessel could look and learn itself, as we modeled, we thought. Even\\nif these buildings, as they appear to the messenger, are not black nor\\nboxes, they give the messenger, looking at itself, the feeling of a\\nblack box, of unknowing, since he it has no idea what is contained in\\nthis message, or how he’ll it will ever get to you and if he it ever\\nwill, but yet he it presses on as the computer commanded, for even if\\nthe messenger reached the edge of the city, it would still have to make\\nit through the suburb offices of black boxes, buildings that had grown\\nso tall and wide as to become indistinguishable from the inner city.\\nStill not lost, it would take even more power and time to deliver the\\nmessage to its recipient.
