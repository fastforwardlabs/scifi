We want you to know that we appreciate your\nbusiness. You are a valued customer and, though confused about several\naspects of our products, you strike me as a decent and intelligent\nconsumer. Personally, I can understand how someone without thorough\nknowledge of this cutting edge technology could find themselves in the\nvery predicament that prompted your letter.</p>\n<p>However, I do not mean to equivocate, Mr. Jim. We will not be\nreimbursing you for the BayesHead 5000. Nor will we be covering your\ncosts for surgical removal. While there are several technical reasons\nthat we cannot accommodate your request, I believe in this particular\ninstance there may be value in addressing your recent error and\ncontextualizing our role in it. After all, what kind of corporation\nwould we be if we implanted our products in your inner ear canal and\nthen failed to address your concerns in such a time of distress!</p>\n<p>Firstly, I sympathize with you and all our clients who have been banned\nfrom traditional gambling venues. Although we take great pride at Monte\nCarlo Inc. in having granted our customers the almost mystical\nprescience that has led to these regulations, we are pained to learn\nthat many customers, such as yourself, have now turned the events of\ntheir own lives —personal disputes with loved ones, even their\nhealth—into venues for wagering their hard earned savings. It is\nperfectly understandable, given the BayesHead’s sophistication, that\nthose who have invested not only in the product but the “costly\noperation” (as you put it), would begin to see such opportunities in\ntheir daily lives.</p>\n<p>But it is my feeling, Mr. Jim, that it is unwise to place bets on your\ndaughter’s, and her friend’s, college applications. It is especially\nunwise in your situation, for a number of reasons, which I will\ninvestigate in the remainder of this letter.</p>\n<p>To begin, I wonder how certain you are that the other fathers in the\npool had either no BayesHead, or a version of the BayesHead older than\nyour own. I’m sure you are aware that we recently released the BayesHead\n6000, which has some remarkable new functionality. It has, in fact,\ntransformed the whole landscape of probabilistic programming, rendering\nyour BayesHead as more of a liability, evidenced by the false sense of\nsecurity it seems to have offered you in your wager. You see, while the\nBayesHead 5000 will input your assumptions and, using Bayesian\nstatistical analysis and advanced scraping tools, model the probable\noutcomes of a given situation, the BayesHead 6000 has much more advanced\nfunctionality. How could we possibly improve on the BayesHead 5000 you\nare wondering? With the BayesHead 6000, our product has actually\ninverted its process. Rather than taking your assumptions as capital t\nTruth, and manipulating the data accordingly, the BayesHead 6000 treats\nthe available data as capital t Truth. It uses your assumptions as\ninputs in its algorithm, but then uses the existing data to correct your\nassumptions, in order to allow you to adjust your model and improve your\npredictions.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, the bets you and Greg placed on your daughters. There\nare certain quantitative measures that are fairly standard, which don’t\nrequire any prior assumptions: GPA, SAT score, list of extracurriculars\nand foreign languages. But then there is the interview, and the personal\nessay. The BayesHead needs your assumptions to measure how these\nvariables will impact the committee. And here you are at a great\ndisadvantage. Because while Greg, with the BayesHead 6000 (surely you\nknow by now that he has one), was able to have his opinion of his\ndaughter corrected with real world data taken from both her online\npresence and her own BayesHead 6000 (the Wilson’s have the family plan),\nyour BayesHead 5000 does not have the functionality to correct your\nperspective on your daughter’s charisma and intellectual curiosity.</p>\n<p>Luckily, with an upgrade to the BayesHead 6000, you’ll no longer be in\ndanger of overestimating your child’s abilities. And, for a limited\ntime, we are offering free installation. Though, do note, as there has\nbeen some confusion about this lately, that standard fees apply to\nremoval of the BayesHead 5000. In my opinion (if I may speak from\npersonal experience) it is actually preferable to keep the old\ntechnology implanted, as there can be a sort of uncomfortable phantom\nitch that recurs with removal.</p>\n<p>I have to say, Mr. Jim, I do sympathize with your position, and\nespecially with your daughter. While we cannot accept responsibility for\nyour predicament, we understand your frustration that your confidence in\nour product has resulted in a depletion of your daughter’s tuition fund\n(although we cannot ignore the silver lining that perhaps she will\nperform as you initially had hoped! now that she has a chance for\nanother round of applications). That said, if it is her desire to attend\na safety school this year, I would like to refer you to the student loan\ndivision of Monte Carlo Inc. They offer extremely reasonable interest\nrates and, as I’ll let them explain, significant discounts when loans\nare paired with a BayesHead upgrade.</p>\n<p>Best Regards,<br>\nGary</p>\n<p>Sales Associate<br>\nMonte Carlo Inc.<br>\n<em>Luck: It’s all in your head</em></p>',frontmatter:{path:"/ff05/bayeshead-5000",title:"BayesHead 5000",report:"ff05",background:"#51ae75",report_title:"Probabilistic Programming",author:"Liam Sweeney",author_link:"https://t.co/1ybyMuIsqv"},excerpt:"Re: Inquiry on Limitations of the BayesHead 5000 Dear Mr. Jim, We here at Monte Carlo Inc. are reaching out in response to your inquiry…",fields:{report_image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/ff05-01-77f1615f984e0988570b5e8558a9e69d-d1b70.png",srcSet:"/static/ff05-01-77f1615f984e0988570b5e8558a9e69d-0fa3f.png 200w,\n/static/ff05-01-77f1615f984e0988570b5e8558a9e69d-f96ce.png 400w,\n/static/ff05-01-77f1615f984e0988570b5e8558a9e69d-d1b70.png 460w"}}},report_gif:{publicURL:"/static/ff05-70f0f34ceff7ee3cbd73d2deb8be1636.gif"},report_strip:{publicURL:"/static/ff05_strip-cbe3d2d4187b7518dc9c7814e68a7975.png"},prologue:'<p>inspired by George Saunder’s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/06/21/i-can-speak">&quot;I Can Speak&quot;</a></p>\n',report_sentence:"<p>In this report we show how to use probabilistic programming to build products and tools for more effective decision making.</p>\n"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
