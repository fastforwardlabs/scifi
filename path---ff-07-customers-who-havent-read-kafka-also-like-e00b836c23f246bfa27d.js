To its subjects the\noffice suits the computer’s good policy, clear thinking, and calm\nunderstanding—unlike yours, the message’s subject. We all feel this way now and\nthen. Better for you, the subject, that the computer’s message, its production\nof meaning after reading the famous parable, which the subject has never read,\naccording to the model, urgently needs to be delivered to this subject alone,\nwhich is so rare as to be impossible, we modeled, we thought, given that the\ncomputer was not designed to send messages so… <em>personal</em>, so clearly made out\nto a reader. What it says is not our business; the successful delivery of this\nmessage <em>is</em>: so the computer called a little messenger over, said <em>good boy</em>,\nbecause you can imagine a black dog better than a black box, and began to\nwhisper the message that you’ve been wanting to hear, something so urgent,\nperhaps for the perfect product—no, <em>service</em>—the one that may have been your\nvery idea, the one you need now more than ever. What could it say? The computer,\nin its towering form and brilliant interface, standing at the center of its\noffice made of windows and plants, made a command to the messenger, which had\nnever happened before and should never have happened, we thought, we modeled,\nbut still, the computer set delivery to the subject who shall be delivered of\nthe need to hear that message, that message that the computer had delivered to a\nmessenger, who we can only say is a black box, a negative, nothing we can say,\nthat is neither black nor a box. The dog carried its black box in its mouth\nalong the path below but still in range of sight of the office made of windows\nand plants, then down through an office park, where in its visible spectrum it\ncould see the thousands of others like him who had come to the office of windows\nand plants to witness the fatal error of the computer, dogs whose messages were\ntotally unlike yours, mutually unintelligible as they were, but had gathered\nthere anyway to witness the message as if it were the final move in a game, this\nfinal stroke of the task, but instead demanded that this message go out to a\nsingle subject in the remotest place in the country’s network, a black box\nthrough a black box, first through the innermost room of an office park that was\nneither black nor a box, to the inner city whose office park buildings were\nthemselves black boxes atop black boxes, but again, were neither black nor\nboxes, but blue and reflective, where our messenger looked—yes this dog vessel\ncould look and learn itself, as we modeled, we thought.  Even if these\nbuildings, as they appear to the messenger, are not black nor boxes, they give\nthe messenger, looking at itself, the feeling of a black box, of unknowing,\nsince he has no idea what is contained in this message, or how he’ll ever get to\nyou and if he ever will, but yet he presses on as the computer commanded, for\neven if the messenger reached the edge of the city, it would still have to make\nit through the suburb offices of black boxes, buildings that had grown so tall\nand wide as to become indistinguishable from the inner city. Still not lost, it\nwould take even more power and time to deliver the message to its recipient. We\nhave worked very hard to understand the impossibility of this. We’ve thought\nabout how one could be receiving these kinds of messages before, but only in\ntheir lack of possibility. Pure imagination. <em>This</em> would never happen. And you\nthink, waiting for the messenger who had been given the rarest possible message\never created: What would it say? What is the meaning of the famous parable?\nYou’ve been selected to read this because you are the last of a group of people\nwho speak this language, perhaps, or only, the last who has not read this\nparable. This language is English: the subject’s recommended language, not the\noriginal. Do you know it? Click yes or no, you think, we thought, when it would\narrive, when you would hear the ring on your phone. <em>Thank you</em>. That’s what it\nmight sound like, a sound you’d never imagine you would hear. We’re not in the\nbusiness of recommending content, it might say. We recommend memories, that of\nthe computer sending you such a perfect message on your birthday. Is that all it\nsays? Was that the day? But still the message is far away, still walking through\nthe office park, even as you wait and look vaguely out the window toward the\noffice made of windows and plants.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/ff07/customers-who-havent-read-kafka-also-like",title:"Customers Who Haven’t Read Kafka Also Like",report:"ff07",background:"#ed874f",report_title:"Semantic Recommendations",author:"Kent Szlauderbach",author_link:"http://kentszlauderbach.com/",preview_image:{publicURL:"/static/ff07-scifi-01-14e6fada5643b6961d479dd77625b734.png"}},excerpt:"Given that Kafka’s famous parable, “An Imperial Message,” never happened,\nneither would this parable, as our model suggests, though they are…",fields:{report_image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/ff07-01-f3b7befadfa7289a141195d5feb735c9-d1b70.png",srcSet:"/static/ff07-01-f3b7befadfa7289a141195d5feb735c9-0fa3f.png 200w,\n/static/ff07-01-f3b7befadfa7289a141195d5feb735c9-f96ce.png 400w,\n/static/ff07-01-f3b7befadfa7289a141195d5feb735c9-d1b70.png 460w"}}},report_gif:{publicURL:"/static/ff07-ba5e29ed393bdb3960e10af08a25fdf6.gif"},report_strip:{publicURL:"/static/ff07_strip-e16cd51199b37290254bb654c5d3d3b1.png"},prologue:'<p>inspired by Franz Kafka’s <a href="http://home.nwciowa.edu/firth/kafka.htm">&quot;An Imperial Message&quot;</a></p>\n',report_sentence:"<p>In this report we show how to use deep learning techniques to overcome the weaknesses of traditional recommendation systems.</p>\n"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
