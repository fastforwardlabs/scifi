Even\\nif these buildings, as they appear to the messenger, are not black nor\\nboxes, they give the messenger, looking at itself, the feeling of a\\nblack box, of unknowing, since he it has no idea what is contained in\\nthis message, or how he’ll it will ever get to you and if he it ever\\nwill, but yet he it presses on as the computer commanded, for even if\\nthe messenger reached the edge of the city, it would still have to make\\nit through the suburb offices of black boxes, buildings that had grown\\nso tall and wide as to become indistinguishable from the inner city.\\nStill not lost, it would take even more power and time to deliver the\\nmessage to its recipient.
