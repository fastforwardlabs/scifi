Ship S-513: Hibernation Room</strong></p>\n<p>The crew awoke to Ship’s message:</p>\n<p><code>PLANET OF INTEREST APPROACHING — ESTIMATED ARRIVAL FOUR HOURS — BEGIN PREPARATION FOR ON-PLANET EXPLORATION.</code></p>\n<div class="md_image half_width">\n<p><img src="/ff06-scifi-01-dbedd054da67fb9945423d67df4c212b.svg" alt="A woman opens her hibernation pod. A display above her reads &#x22;Hibernation\ntime: 7 months&#x22;."></p>\n</div>\n<p>Rue glanced at the monitor — they’d been out for seven months this time.</p>\n<p>"Someday I’d like to know what exactly your definition of \'interesting\'\nis, Ship," Dariux grumbled. "Sometimes it seems like \'interesting\' just\nmeans likely to get me killed."</p>\n<p><code>PREPARE FOR ON-PLANET EXPLORATION,</code> Ship continued, giving no\nindication that it had heard or registered the complaint.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Planet I-274: Cave</strong></p>\n<p>Taera stood in the middle of hundreds of egg-like structures. They were\neach about a meter tall, with a covering that looked like a cross\nbetween leather and metal. They seemed to pulse slightly. A low humming\nsuffused the cave.</p>\n<div class="md_image half_width">\n<p><img src="/ff06-scifi-02-363b9f0d3f3593f44a9afd69e84bb0cc.svg" alt="A person in full astronaut gear is surrounded by large eggs."></p>\n</div>\n<p>"This one’s giving off significant heat," Taera said, as she approached\nthe nearest one.</p>\n<p>"Careful, Captain. I’m getting a bad feeling here," Dariux called from\nthe cave entrance.</p>\n<p>The humming in the room cut out. The new, eerie silence was pierced by\nTaera’s scream. The structure she’d approached had broken open and a\ncreature that looked like a cross between a stingray and a starfish had\nattached itself to the front of her helmet. Taera’s body stiffened and\nshe fell straight back. Dariux and Giyana rushed to help.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ship S-513: Entrance</strong></p>\n<p>Giyana and Dariux approached the ship’s doors, carrying Taera between\nthem.</p>\n<p>"I can’t let you bring her in," Rue said from the operations panel. "We\ndon’t know what that thing attached to her is. It could contaminate the\nentire ship."</p>\n<p>"Let us in!" Giyana demanded, "She’s still alive! We can help her!"</p>\n<p>"I can’t — "</p>\n<p>The doors opened. Ship had overridden Rue and let them in.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Ship S-513: Control Room</strong></p>\n<p>Four of the nine crew members were now dead, and two others weren’t\nresponding. The aliens that had hatched from Taera’s body had taken over\nhalf of the ship.</p>\n<p>Taera’s death meant Rue was now acting captain, and therefore had access\nto the control room and diagnostic information not available to the rest\nof the crew.</p>\n<p>"Ship," she commanded, "explain the decision to explore this planet."</p>\n<p><code>PROBABILITY OF MISSION SUCCESS WAS ESTIMATED AT 95%.</code></p>\n<p>"That’s just a number and we both know it, Ship. Show me the success\npredictions for your last five missions."</p>\n<div class="md_image half_width">\n<p><img src="/ff06-scifi-03-38455b6109c324b1759c3d0cefeaba48.svg" alt="A list of mission success predictions. The current mission success prediction\nis 95%."></p>\n</div>\n<p>A table was projected on the wall facing Rue. The missions had success\npredictions ranging from 98% to 13%.</p>\n<p>"Show me the features going into these predictions."</p>\n<p><code>I UTILIZE THOUSANDS OF FEATURES, PROCESSED THROUGH COMPLEX NEURAL NETWORKS. IT IS VERY TECHNICAL. HUMANS CANNOT UNDERSTAND.</code></p>\n<p>"Apply the interpretability module, then, and show me the top features\ncontributing to the predictions."</p>\n<p>Five columns were added. The most highlighted column was titled\n"Potential Profit."</p>\n<p>"Show local interpretations for these features."</p>\n<p>The cells in the columns shifted into red and blue highlights. For the\nprofit column high profits were shown in a dark blue, indicating that\nthis was the strongest contributing feature for the prediction of\nsuccess. For the missions with lower success predictions, the profit\nvalues were much lower and highlighted in red, indicating that they were\ndriving the success predictions lower for those missions.</p>\n<p>"Ship," Rue said thoughtfully, "probability of crew survival is a\nfeature in your mission success prediction, isn’t it? Add that column to\nthe table."</p>\n<div class="md_image full_width">\n<p><img src="/ff06-scifi-04-411413ee4b6211655a62558808684045.svg" alt="The missions success predictions with indicators of the factors that played\nthe largest role in the predictions. It shows the main factor driving the\nprediction for mission success is a high potential profit."></p>\n</div>\n<p>A column titled "Crew Survival" was added to the table. The values\nvaried between 88% and 12%, and none of them were highlighted as\nimportant to the success prediction. The probability assigned to crew\nsurvival for the current mission was 14%.</p>\n<p>"You were wrong, ship. I do understand. It’s not complicated at all."\nRue said. "All of your decisions have been driven by this model, haven’t\nthey? This definition of \'mission success\'?"</p>\n<p><code>FEATURE SELECTION IS SET BY SPACE EXPLOITATION CORP. A SHIP CAN ONLY WORK WITH THE MODEL IT IS ASSIGNED.</code></p>\n<p>"Yes, yes, I get it. Just following orders. Ship, we’re going to start a\nnew model. Profits are not going to be a feature. Maximize the chances\nof crew survival."</p>\n<p><code>CALCULATING NEW MODEL. DECISION SYSTEM WILL NOW RESTART.</code></p>\n<p>The lights dimmed briefly in the control room. As they returned to full\npower an alarm started, and Ship’s voice returned with a new sense of\nurgency. The adjusted feature importances and success prediction for the\ncurrent mission appeared on the wall.</p>\n<div class="md_image half_width">\n<p><img src="/ff06-scifi-05-be0a0d18814ff24df60e2a3c91230f2e.svg" alt="The recalculated success prediction.

INITIATE SHIP SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE TO DESTROY ALIEN CONTAMINATION.</code></p>\n<p>"All right, Ship, good to have you on our side. Start the process," said\nRue. "And download the data about your previous success model to my\npersonal account."</p>\n<p><strong>5. Epilogue</strong></p>\n<p>Rue and the other surviving crew members made it home safely in the\nescape pod. The alien contamination was destroyed. Using the data on the\nprevious model, Rue successfully sued Space Exploitation Corp. under the\n"Algorithms Hostile to Human Life" act. She won the case and received a\nlarge settlement for the crew and their beneficiaries. Space\nExploitation Corp.\'s reputation took a hit, but it continues to run the\nmajority of space exploration missions.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/ff06/the-definition-of-success",title:"The Definition of Success",report:"ff06",background:"#eb6e62",report_title:"Interpretability",author:"Grant Custer",author_link:"https://twitter.com/GrantCuster",preview_image:{publicURL:"/static/ff06-scifi-01-c5a954e70021e806dd5b65eea485a7eb.png"}},excerpt:"1.
