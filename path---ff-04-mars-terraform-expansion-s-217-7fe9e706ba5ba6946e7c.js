She likes the challenge of the heirloom varieties, even\nif she is on her fourth basil plant this cycle.</p>\n<p>She walks over to the kitchen and takes her coffee from the dispenser. After a\nmoment of consideration she instructs it, “Breakfast: yogurt and oatmeal.”\nTaking her first sip of coffee, she approaches the transparent wall screen that\nsubdivides her studio apartment, swiping up to clear the ambient generative\nartwork and bring up her morning news brief.</p>\n<p>The top item reads “Vote on Mars Terraform Expansion S-217 Today,” followed by\nheadlines on the safety concerns about a new synth-meat hybrid and a fashion\npiece on the new biomod trend of decorative “dragon scale” skin grafts. An\nanimated reminder to do her morning calisthenics bounces in the lower-right\ncorner.</p>\n<p>Fatima blinks at the terraforming headline, opening a one-paragraph summary of\nthe basic issues surrounded by a shifting network graph of opinion writing and\nvideo on the issue. She gives an upward nod, dismissing the summary and zooming\nout to get a feel of the graph. Grouped by similarity of word use and sentiment,\nthe pieces are separated into two main clusters, the pro-terraforming\nexpansionists on the left and eco-conservative anti-expansionists on the right.\nSmaller clusters appear on the extreme side of each group, tugging them apart,\nwhile the moderates hold -- for now -- at the center. Influential opinions\nappear larger, weighted by shares and recommendations across the social graph.\nThe network web pulses as gravitational forces are adjusted to reflect shifts in\npublic opinion.</p>\n<p><img src="/ff04-scifi_clusters-29d0aaa1f1849f40c08f2295ab4a3238.svg" alt="test image"></p>\n<p>Fatima eyes the filter mechanism and directs it to show only sources she\'s read\nand recommended before. The display fades out the majority of the nodes, leaving\nonly her trusted sources. She blinks at the display mode toggle and a\npersonalized summary of these sources appears, breaking down the agreements and\ndisagreements between each and putting them in the context of pieces she has\npreviously viewed. The summary indicates that one article, by a source she has\nfound especially influential in the past, has been extremely controversial. She\nsends that piece to her e-paper. She\'ll read it in full over breakfast.</p>\n<p><img src="/ff04-scifi_summary-4573783a24694ee59b1525c9e048472d.svg" alt="test image"></p>\n<p>Feeling like she has a reasonable handle on the issue, she zooms back out to the\nfull graph, and switches to the trending view. It\'s dominated by two impassioned\npleas, on the pro-expansion side from a Mars colonist famous for his heroic\nrescue of a fellow citizen a couple of years back, and on the con side from the\nauthoritative-yet-affable scientist host of a popular space-experience program.\nThe popularity of those pieces is not a surprise, but there is a less familiar\npresence — an eco-art activist group has created experience-art simulating a\nhaunted post-development Mars, using historical imagery from Earth\'s eco-crisis.\nIntrigued, she saves the experience for after breakfast, swipes down to return\nthe screen to its resting animation, and sits down to read and eat.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/ff04/mars-terraform-expansion-s-217",title:"Mars Terraform Expansion S-217",report:"ff04",background:"#3277ba",report_title:"Summarization",author:"Grant Custer",author_link:"http://feed.grantcuster.com/",preview_image:{publicURL:"/scifi/static/ff04-scifi_clusters-29d0aaa1f1849f40c08f2295ab4a3238.svg"}},excerpt:"Fatima wakes to a simulated bedroom sunrise and the smell of coffee.
