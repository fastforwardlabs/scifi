The numerous excavations around the\npresent-day city of Jolfa on the banks of the Araz–beginning with\nthe English explorer Roger Dimblesby’s expedition in 1878–have\nfailed to unearth so much as an arrowhead. Yet there are still those\nwho hold fast to the truth of the city’s historical existence, owing\nperhaps to the following account of its abrupt end.</p>\n<p>In its eighth-hundred year, a young prince assumed the throne of\nHavurtat after the occultation<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> of\nhis father. The young prince had only recently returned to the city\nfrom the frontiers, having rendered his services in the army of the\nBronze-age emperor to whom the city pledged fealty. Because of his\nconscription into the army at an early age, he was unaccustomed to the\ncomforts and plenitude of courtly life in which he found himself at\nthe center, after ascending the seat of power. For the first few years\nof his reign, the young prince freely indulged in the powers and\npleasures of his throne. He threw extravagant banquets, hunted exotic\ngame animals, and commissioned ambitious construction projects, until–\nas so often happens to princes of happy cities–he grew bored and\nunhappy, and began contemplating his place in the scheme of things. He\nwithdrew from court and began to spend more and more of his time in\nthe library and in the company of the learned men in his court–\nseers, poets, judges, and advisers.</p>\n<p>One night, standing on the terrace of his palace, looking down at the\nmatrix of squat brick houses of precisely equal dimensions that\ninhabited square plats of land separated by roads that stretched out\nto the city’s ramparts, the prince was seized by a despondency he had\nnever experienced before. He asked his guards to fetch his advisers,\nwho, roused from their sleep, were presently brought before the\nprince, unkempt in their night-time robes.</p>\n<p>—How do we rule this city? The prince asked his advisers.</p>\n<p>—Justly, replied the advisers in unison.</p>\n<p>—What are the instruments of our rule?</p>\n<p>—Our laws, prince.</p>\n<p>—Who provides these laws?</p>\n<p>The advisers were startled by this line of inquiry, especially the\noldest among them, who had served not only the prince’s father but\nalso his grandfather; no prince, as far as anyone could remember, had\nquestioned the laws and his own authority. They stuttered over each\nother for an answer before one stepped forward and spoke.</p>\n<p>—Prince, surely you know who wrote our laws–it was the first\nprince.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup>\nHe wrote our laws, which are manifest in the functioning of our city.\nOur laws are perfectly devised. They have not been broken in eight\nhundred years.</p>\n<p>The prince was not satisfied with his advisers’ answers. He tossed and\nturned in his bed all night. Just before dawn, he got up and opened\nthe doors to his chamber where two sentries were standing alert, ready\nto pull their swords–in rather needless caution, as the prince, both\nfor his immortality and the city’s unbreakable laws, faced no threats.</p>\n<p>—Take the strongest horse from my stable, the prince whispered to one\nof the sentries, and ride. Bring me back the vilest and craftiest man\nyou find: a man who cannot abide order, a man who never keeps his\nword, who has no compunction in stealing, who kills at his whim.</p>\n<p>The sentry bowed his head and marched away.</p>\n<p>Time passed. Days. Months. The prince carried on as before,\ndisinterestedly sitting at the head of flamboyant banquets, hunting\ngame in the forests past the city’s circular ramparts, anointing new\ntemples with the blood of gazelles and deer–but the sentry and his\nmission remained often in his thoughts. One year later, the sentry\ncame back to the city. He entered the court deferentially, accompanied\nby a toothless, hunch-backed old man whose eyes were sunk deep inside\nhis head.</p>\n<p>The prince looked at the man and sneered. —This old crow will break\nour unbreakable laws? He looks like he can’t even break a piece of\nbread.</p>\n<p>—My prince, the sentry replied, I travelled to the edges of the world.\nI met hundreds of men of unspeakable vice, each surpassing the last in\nthe art of evil. I met men who had sold their own brothers and\nsisters. But when I met this old man, the crimes of everyone else\nappeared to be nothing more than childish games. He is three hundred\nyears old, and the reason he stands before us, despite his many\ntransgressions, is because of his ability to outwit every judge and\nexecutioner.</p>\n<p>The prince leaned forward in his chair. —Old man, do you know that I\nrule over a perfect city. Our forefathers divined laws for us. The\nlaws are everywhere. Nothing has happened in this city in eight\nhundred years in violation of the order set by its founders. What more\ncould any sovereign desire? But this does not satisfy me. How can I be\nsure that I am sovereign when I cannot intervene in this order? How\ncan I exercise my will, if everything happens as it is supposed to?</p>\n<p>When he had finished, the old man responded in a soft rasping voice. —All\nlaws can be broken.</p>\n<p>—Then show me how.</p>\n<p>—Give me a fortnight, your grace.</p>\n<p>For two weeks, the old man criss-crossed the city’s streets, talking\nto its denizens. He avoided his lodgings at the palace, and spent his\nnights with the seers, learning about the city’s beginnings, the first\nprince, and its laws. He observed that Havurtans, like all people, had\namong them deceitful, violent, greedy, and malicious characters. But\nthe laws of the city, he understood, had created ideal conditions,\nwhere an optimal distribution of resources, pre-emptive action against\nmalicious actors, and transparency had not only disincentivized\nlaw-breaking but allowed the authorities to stop potential\nlaw-breakers before they broke the law.</p>\n<p>He also learned that the eternal source of these laws was the prince,\nbefore whose anxious eyes, the old man stood once again two weeks\nlater. —Your grace, the old man said, what is said about your city is\ntrue. The authors of your city’s laws foresaw and understood every\nevent and occurrence in this city, even down, it seems, to the very\nmovement of leaves. The laws they wrote indeed cannot be broken.\nHowever, there’s one event they failed to pre-empt; there is one law\nthat can be broken.</p>\n<p>—Well, what are you waiting for? Tell me! The prince exclaimed.</p>\n<p>—Regicide.</p>\n<p>Saying this, the old man quietly stepped back. The prince had his\nanswer. Slowly, he stood up from his chair and descended from the\ndais. He gestured at the sentry, who fearfully approached, his hand\nclutching the hilt of his sword; the prince tapped the sentry’s hand\ngently, and ordered him to strike.</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id="fn-1">\n As far as we know,\nHerodotus was the first to provide a record of Havurtat, which he no\ndoubt culled from Avestan sources that have since been lost. The\nGreco-Egyptian alchemist Zosimus of Panopolis elaborated on this\nrecord in the Fifth Century by placing it within the scheme of his\ninquiry into the nature of change; and which, later, passing through\nthe Abbasid philosophers’ treatises on the ideal polities and through\ntranslations into French and Italian of those texts by seventeenth\ncentury philologists, finally appears in English sometime in the early\nnineteenth century.\n<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id="fn-2">\n Havurtan princes were\nimmortal. Herodotus understands this method of regnal succession as a\ntransmigration of the soul, whereby the soul of the father migrates\ninto the body of his son, replacing the latter. However, he also\nleaves open to suggestion the nature of the son’s soul: to wit, is\nthere a replacement (in which case, what happens to the son’s soul?)\nor is the son merely a corporeal vessel for the father’s soul, which\nis itself an ongoing transposition of the soul of the first prince\nthrough generations of bodies? In either case, the outcome is the\nsame; the first prince remains the constant sovereign. Interestingly,\nZosimus rejects Herodotus’ explanation and describes the succession as\na transmutation–the fusing of father and son into a new prince.\n<a href="#fnref-2" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id="fn-3">\n It should be mentioned here that although Havurtans\nlacked a system of writing, they were not an oral culture. Herodotus\nexplains their complex system of knowledge retention and extraction\nbased on metal rods, which were inserted at varying lengths and at\ncertain, determined distances in the ground. These “records” could be\ninterpreted only by seers who spent their entire lives learning the\nrelationships between the metal sequences and divining meaning from\nthem. Zosius expands on this account by speculating that the diverse\nproperties of the metals that composed the rods, theorizing that the\nrecords were the sounds and echoes emitted once the rods were struck.\n<a href="#fnref-3" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>',frontmatter:{path:"/ff08/havurtat",title:"Havurtat",report:"ff08",background:"#19aee6",report_title:"Multi-Task Learning",author:"Umair Kazi",author_link:"https://twitter.com/nightcolander",preview_image:{publicURL:"/static/08-01-952dd26bbef7d48fcb287493159e03ec.png"}},excerpt:"There is a consensus among archaeologists and historians of the Near\nEast that the lost city of Havurtat  As far as we know,\nHerodotus was…",fields:{report_image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/ff08-01-cd0ac6ee5f8d5c07cf406cfc00f19847-cc0a4.png",srcSet:"/static/ff08-01-cd0ac6ee5f8d5c07cf406cfc00f19847-4a1f6.png 200w,\n/static/ff08-01-cd0ac6ee5f8d5c07cf406cfc00f19847-cefa6.png 400w,\n/static/ff08-01-cd0ac6ee5f8d5c07cf406cfc00f19847-cc0a4.png 480w"}}},report_strip:{publicURL:"/static/ff08_strip-8eddebaf9a5fc732189930d20dd82a00.png"},prologue:"<p>inspired by Jorge Luis Borges</p>\n",report_sentence:"<p>In this report, we show how, for complex tasks, multi-task learning can improve the accuracy, inference, and maintainability of models.</p>\n"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
